# Little Timmy - Autonomous Robot Project

## Overview
In January 2024, a team of eight convened in **Software Lab 1 of the SCSC building** to enhance "Little Timmy" the robot. The project involved implementing **hardware and software optimizations**, focusing on the following subsystems:

- **STM32 (Microcontroller Programming & Embedded Systems)**
- **Android App Development (Robot Interface & Control)**
- **Raspberry Pi (Processing & Communications)**
- **Image Recognition (Computer Vision & Machine Learning)**
- **Algorithm Design (Pathfinding & Optimization)**

The team developed an **autonomous mobile robot** capable of traversing a predefined arena, identifying obstacles, and optimizing its path using advanced algorithms.

## üì± Android Application Features
The **Android app** served as the primary control interface for "Little Timmy," enabling remote operations, debugging, and real-time monitoring.

### Key Components:
- **Bluetooth Connection Status**: Displays whether the robot is connected.
- **Arena View**: A graphical representation of the robot‚Äôs environment.
- **Start Buttons**: Triggers Task 1 and Task 2 execution.

### Controller Tabs:
- **Main Actions**:
  - Set the robot's **initial position**.
  - Place and clear obstacles.
  - Edit obstacle position and orientation dynamically.
- **Manual Drive**: Allows for **manual override** and direct control of the robot.
- **Settings**:
  - Toggle **Debug Mode**.
  - Send **debugging scripts** to the robot.
- **Chat Section**:
  - Displays **status messages** (e.g., Bluetooth connection, image recognition logs).
  - Allows direct **text-based commands**.
- **Portal Component**:
  - Maintains a list of **paired devices**.
  - Enables quick **debugging and reconnection**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Development
A **simulator** was developed to test the navigation algorithms before deploying them onto the robot.

### Path Optimization Strategies:
1. **Hamiltonian Path Algorithm**
   - Determines the optimal **sequence for visiting obstacles**.
2. **Modified A* Algorithm**
   - Computes the **least-cost path**, incorporating heuristics.
   - Uses the **Manhattan Distance** metric:
     \[ d = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \]
   - Penalizes **turns** while encouraging **straight-line movements**.

### Key Adjustments:
- Implemented **higher penalties for turns**.
- Ensured **smooth transitions between waypoints**.
- Prioritized **efficiency in real-time execution**.
